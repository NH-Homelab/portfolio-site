# Portfolio Site
A portfolio site created with Next.js and Material UI. Check out the live site [here](https://nickhenley.dev)!

## Recent Updates
* Created a backend to replace the functionality of the static asset service. Portfolio milestones are now fetched from a live database.

## Future Changes
* Automatic deployments: deployment involves building the static site files and copying them to a minio bucket. I'd like to create github actions to handle this process.
* Milestone Structure Change: I want projects to be made up of a list of smaller updates which will enable me to make more frequent updates to the timeline.

git clone https://github.com/NH-Homelab/portfolio-site
