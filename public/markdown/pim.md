##### Portland Indigenous Marketplace

---

The Portland Indigenous Marketplace project was a Customer Relationship Management web application written in Next.js and Tailwind on the frontend. The goal was for vendors to register with the site and be able to see upcoming events that they could request to attend. Since the events were capacity constrained, the admin was able to approve or deny requests to join. Furthermore, vendors that attended events had to abide to certain rules (like showing up when they committed, or being respectful of the venue). The system also allowed the admin to track infractions on the rules.

###### Jumpstarting the Project

---

Before the project began, we needed an idea of what it would be. The initial description we were given was about one sentence long, not enough to make an entire app out of. My co-lead and I started asking questions about the app such as

* What features would an app like this need?
* What kind of data models would we create?
* What pages would we create to implement this app?

With this starting place, we were able to schedule a meeting with the organization and refine the project idea. I'm glad that we went into the meeting having already wrapped our heads around the problem a bit. We were able to refine the idea based on feedback from the organization, and start mocking up the site in figma. From there, we received more feedback before starting development.

###### Leadership Role

---

The biggest challenge for this project was assuming a leadership role. When the organization chose me for team lead, I requested a Co-Lead for the project. I wanted to make sure I had another developer that was comfortable with creating full stack web applications and to help manage a team. I'm glad I made this choice because we were able to divide responsibilities well.

My primary tasks as team lead were keeping track of project progress and assigning tickets. In this way, I was in something like a Project Manager's role. Each week I led a standup where we would talk about what we worked on, what we're working on next, and provided a space for the team to ask for help or collaborate on issues. This weekly meeting ended up being a great way to keep development on track as the team would often work together for an hour a week during this meeting.
