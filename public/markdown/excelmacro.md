##### Excel Macro Project

---

As part of my role with Leeds, I designed and implemented an excel macro to help with data entry tasks that often repeated the same data in multiple places.

The benefit of a tool like this is removing sources of incosistencies between different spreadsheets and improving team efficiency. 

###### The Workbook

---

The excel workbook had a table with all course data across many years, and then multiple other sheets that were term specific. That meant that the same data was inserted into at least 2 tables manually. 

###### Macro Functionality

---

A user could insert one or more rows into the "intake" sheet in the workbook. When they were ready, they could activate the macro at the click of a button embedded in the top of the sheet. This would parse the rows inserted and automatically copy the data into the appropriate sheets.

###### Data Cleaning

---

While working on this project, I encountered many inconsistencies in the way data was formatted. Dates could be in different formats or fields that could be binary had many different ways of saying the same thing. I took it upon my self to start cleaning up the data. This included choosing a consistent way of representing the data fields and enforcing the new rules using data validation. I also used my macro to find and fix the inconsistencies automatically instead of manually correcting years of course data.

###### Software Development Lifecycle

---

A big takeaway from this project was the reality of the software development lifecycle. I had an idea of what the user wanted and was able to talk through features and plan out what the macro was supposed to accomplish. Then I would demo the tool and receive feedback that I implemented until the product matched the client's expectations.
