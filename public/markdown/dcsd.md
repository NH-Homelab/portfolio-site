##### Summer Internship

---

This was my first professional experience with software development. This was very early in my programming journey, so my role here was focused on learning much more than producing code. 

###### Documentation Project 

---

One of my first tasks was to add documentation to a Java Spring Boot project. They were having issues with a message broker called Rabbit MQ. My job was to find all places in code that touched Rabbit MQ so that the development team could debug it. This task was very difficult for me at first because I'd never done a deep dive into enterprise code. 

I eventually learned to leverage IDE tools to search for dependencies and track down how different classes / objects were used throughout the project. After taking notes, adding code comments to various functions and classes, I was able to create a diagram for the team's internal documentation that showed how different parts of the program interacted with Rabbit MQ. 

###### Database Transfer Project

---

Another task I was given was to transfer data from one SQL database to another. The program needed to output the data it transferred to stdout so that it could be verified that all the data was successfully transferred. I had already learned the basics of SQL with java at this point, but I learned a lot about how enterprise projects structure data and manage user permissions and access to services and data.

###### Tableau Report Project

---

After the database transfer project, I was tasked with combining data across multiple databases to generate reports and insights on different schools in the district. I had never used Tableau before, and had to learn more about joining different datasets using primary keys.
