                    I recently graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder and love building thingsâ€”from full-stack apps to running my own homelab with containers and VMs. I've been learning Kubernetes and GitHub workflows for automatic deployment, and I'm interested in cybersecurity, AI, and embedded systems. In college, I helped create apps and websites for nonprofits through Blueprint Boulder. Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, reading, and gaming.
